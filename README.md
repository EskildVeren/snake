I wanna create snake

## Why does this exist?

Snake is a game that many has created before, and that I myself have created several times. It will therefore be quick to implement, meaning I can try out a new method of creating canvas games, that I may be able to apply to later games. I want to create a system for UI elements such as buttons in canvas, something I havent done before.

## December 24th, Almost done with snake game;

I have now created most of the gamelogic for the snake game. I am therefore soon ready to start on the other parts of the game. Merry ChristmasðŸŒ²
